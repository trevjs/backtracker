Backtracker - Backbone based tool for managing projects and tasks
=================================================================

About
-----
Backtracker is a sample project created by Trevor Schara in order to demonstrate
JavaScript knowledge.  It uses backbone and backbone.marionette as an MV*
framework.  It currently allows for the creation of projects, and tasks
associated with projects, and switching between active projects to view
the list of tasks for each project.

Backtracker is still under development.

The following resources were instrumental in its develoopment:

- [Backbone Todo](http://backbonejs.org/examples/todos/index.html)
- [backbonerails.com](http://http://www.backbonerails.com)
- *Developing Backbone.js Applications* by Addy Osmani. O'Reilly  Media Inc., 2013.
